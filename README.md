# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction Model

![Family Image](family-2073604_640.webp)

## Overview
This project is a machine learning model designed to predict the cost of medical insurance. Using a dataset of patient data, we apply multiple regression techniques to train models and evaluate their performance. The model can predict insurance costs based on factors like age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
- Feature encoding for categorical variables
- Training multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Model evaluation using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R2 score
- Visualization of model predictions
- GUI application for easy prediction using new data
- Model saving and loading using Joblib
